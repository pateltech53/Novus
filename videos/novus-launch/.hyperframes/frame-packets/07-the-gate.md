## Frame 7 — Month twelve stops the clock

- scene: A huge ink month counter ticks 01→12 on white and slams with a gold underline; the camera pushes through the digits into the real "Pitch me" gate screen in its bezel device.
- voiceover: "Then month twelve — stops the clock. To close the year, you have to pitch."
- duration: 4.032s
- poster: 3s
- transition_in: zoom-through
- status: outline
- src: compositions/frames/07-the-gate.html
- asset_candidates: assets/tank.webp — the year-gate "Pitch me" screen render
- type: feature_showcase
- persuasion: The one rule stated as law — scarcity of passage
- beat: anticipation + weight
- blueprint: dataviz-countup (Adapt — the counted number IS the hero, camera pushes THROUGH it; counter in ink on white; the gold moment is a `#FFC24B` underline bar sweep + `#B7791F` gate line, NOT a glow)
- focal: assets/tank.webp
- roles: tank.webp = cutout (the gate screen inside its bezel device, the landing surface)
- sfx: typing, impact-bass-1, sparkle

Adapt: identical machinery to the dark build; the slam's gold bloom is replaced by a `#FFC24B` underline bar sweeping under the digits (`stat-bars-and-fills`) — gold as a fill, per the addendum; digits stay ink on white.
Scene 1 (0.0–1.2s): On "Then month twelve", the mono counter "MONTH 01" dead-center (stat-value ramp ~14cqw, ink, tnum) ticks 01→12 accelerating (`counting-dynamic-scale`).
Scene 2 (1.2–2.2s): On "— stops the clock.", the counter SLAMS at 12; the gold underline bar sweeps beneath the digits; a short dead-still beat.
Scene 3 (2.2–3.1s): On "To close the year,", the camera pushes THROUGH the digits (`multi-phase-camera` + `motion-blur-streak`); the gate screen (tank.webp in its bezel device, ≈18% width) arrives centered (inverse zoom-through seam).
Scene 4 (3.1–4.032s): On "you have to pitch.", the gate line "FISCAL YEAR 1 · THE GATE" reveals beneath in mono `#B7791F` word-by-word; the OPEN THE CAMERA capsule brightens once on "pitch". Holds.

narrativeRole: The twist — this sim has a gate no other sim has: the year is closed by a performance, not a menu.
keyMessage: The year doesn't close until you pitch it.

# Counting with Dynamic Scale

A number counts from A → B while its transform scale grows to the final size — escalating visual weight ("this is impressive") without tweening `font-size` or forcing text layout on every frame. The final font size is static CSS; only the transform changes.

## How It Works

Two synchronized tweens at the SAME timeline position with the SAME ease: (1) a proxy value rendered as text via `onUpdate` (`Math.round(...).toLocaleString()`), (2) the counter's transform `scale: START_SCALE → 1`, where `START_SCALE = START_SIZE / END_SIZE`. A suffix (`%`, `×`, `+`) slides in AFTER the count lands — the number gets its own beat — and a label fades in early.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="counter-wrap">
  <span class="counter" id="counter">0</span><span class="counter-suffix">{suffix}</span>
</div>
<div class="counter-label">{label}</div>
```

```css
.counter-wrap {
  display: flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  justify-content: center;
  width: {counterContainerWidth}; /* fixed width — no layout shift as digit count changes */
}
.counter {
  font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums; /* MANDATORY — digits keep equal width */
  display: inline-block;
  font-size: {endSize}; /* final size is static; GSAP animates scale, not font-size */
  transform-origin: center center;
}
.counter-suffix {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(20px);
}
```

```js
const counter = document.getElementById("counter");
const state = { value: 0 };
const START_SCALE = START_SIZE / END_SIZE;

// Count value — onUpdate changes text only
tl.to(
  state,
  {
    value: TARGET_VALUE,
    duration: COUNT_DUR,
    ease: COUNT_EASE,
    onUpdate: () => {
      counter.textContent = Math.round(state.value).toLocaleString();
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Visual growth — compositor transform sharing the count's timing + ease
tl.fromTo(counter, { scale: START_SCALE }, { scale: 1, duration: COUNT_DUR, ease: COUNT_EASE }, 0);

// Suffix slides in AFTER the count completes
tl.to(
  ".counter-suffix",
  { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: SUFFIX_DUR, ease: `back.out(${SUFFIX_BOUNCE_FACTOR})` },
  COUNT_DUR,
);

// Label fades in early
tl.from(".counter-label", { opacity: 0, y: 12, duration: LABEL_DUR, ease: "power2.out" }, LABEL_AT);
```

## Variations

- **Direct `innerText` tween (no proxy)** — GSAP can tween `innerText` directly for a number-only counter; keep the proxy form when you need locale formatting or suffix logic. The scale tween stays separate either way:

```js
tl.to(
  counter,
  { innerText: TARGET_VALUE, duration: COUNT_DUR, ease: COUNT_EASE, snap: { innerText: 1 } },
  0,
);
```

- **3D depth entry** — add a `tl.from(".counter", { z: -300, ... }, 0)` push-in; requires `perspective` on `.counter-wrap` and `transform-style: preserve-3d` on the counter.
- **Multi-stat coordinated reveal** — 3 stats counting in parallel share the SAME ease, duration, and start position so they finish together (a chord, not an arpeggio). Each stat usually also needs a paired graphic (bar / ring / stars) — don't stop at the number; see [stat-bars-and-fills.md](stat-bars-and-fills.md).

| TARGET_VALUE          | 2–3 digits ideal                            | 4+ digits needs a wider container; must fit at END_SIZE without clipping      |
| START_SIZE / END_SIZE | START ≈ 40–60% of END                       | design inputs used once for START_SCALE; never tween either                   |

| COUNT_EASE            | `power2.out` / `power3.out` ⭐ / `expo.out` | shared by value + scale; more `.out` = more dramatic deceleration at the peak |

| SUFFIX_BOUNCE_FACTOR  | 1.4–2.0                                     | overshoot is fine on the suffix (it's punctuation, not data)                  |
| LABEL_AT / LABEL_DUR  | AT < COUNT_DUR/2; 0.4–0.7s                  | label arrives before the count peaks                                          |

## Critical Constraints

- **`tabular-nums` mandatory** + fixed-width container as belt-and-suspenders — without them digit-count transitions (9 → 10 → 100) jitter as glyph widths change.
- **Never set `fontSize` in `onUpdate`** — final type size is static CSS; only the transform changes per frame. Keep `onUpdate` O(1): set text only, no style writes or DOM creation.
- **`Math.round`, not `Math.floor`** — halfway through the final integer should already display the final value.
- **Avoid `back.out` / `elastic.out` on the counter itself** — overshoot makes the number look unstable (it's data, not decoration). Grow in place, don't bounce.
- **Label is BIG TEXT, not a page-style caption** — a tiny paragraph under a hero-size number reads as visual noise in video. Display-size, uppercase, tracked: the label is part of the headline.

# Motion-Blur Streak

Real motion blur isn't available to a seeked renderer (it integrates over shutter time), so this rule **fakes** it for a fast fly-in or hard camera push-through. The whole point is the _coupling_: the blur envelope rides the **same ease and window** as the position tween, so peak blur lands exactly on peak speed and the element is razor-sharp the instant it stops. Two paths:

- **(A) Directional SVG blur** — inline `<feGaussianBlur stdDeviation="X 0">` (X on the motion axis, 0 across it), tweened via a proxy. Cleanest; a true directional smear.
- **(B) Echo / ghost trail** — 2–4 duplicates at decreasing opacity, offset backward along the motion vector, collapsing into the lead as it settles. No filter cost; a stylized "speed-line" trail.

**Entrances and mid-shot moves only — never a mid-composition exit.** A blurred element fleeing off-frame mid-composition reads as a glitch; a hard exit between scenes is the transition's job (`../../transitions/overview.md`). One sanctioned scope extension: the envelope may ride the **camera wrapper** during a travel leg — see the Camera-Travel Carve-Out.

## How It Works

A fast `out`-eased move front-loads velocity — fastest off the start, bleeding to zero at the settle. Map the blur/echo envelope onto that same curve: position travels from an off-frame / pushed-back start to rest over `MOVE_DUR`; in lockstep on the same window and ease the smear goes `PEAK_BLUR → 0` (A) or the ghosts collapse onto the lead (B). By the settle the element is fully crisp and dwells ≥1 s — the contrast between violent streak and still, sharp settle IS the effect. GSAP can't tween an SVG attribute directly: tween a plain `{ v }` proxy and write `setAttribute("stdDeviation", …)` in `onUpdate`, seeding it once at setup so a seek to t=0 shows the streaked start.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip; overflow: hidden on the scene (the smear extends past rest) -->
<svg width="0" height="0" aria-hidden="true" style="position: absolute">
  <filter id="streak" x="-50%" y="-50%" width="200%" height="200%">
    <feGaussianBlur id="streak-blur" in="SourceGraphic" stdDeviation="0 0" />
  </filter>
</svg>
<div class="streak-el" id="streak-el" style="filter: url(#streak)">{phrase}</div>
<!-- Path B instead: N-1 aria-hidden .streak-ghost duplicates BEHIND the lead, no filter -->
```

```js
// Path A — proxy-tweened directional blur.
const blurNode = document.getElementById("streak-blur");
const blurProxy = { v: PEAK_BLUR };
const writeBlur = () => blurNode.setAttribute("stdDeviation", `${blurProxy.v} 0`); // X axis only
writeBlur(); // seed frame 0 — a seek to t=0 must show the streaked start, not a sharp pre-frame

tl.fromTo(
  "#streak-el",
  { x: ENTER_FROM_X, opacity: 0 },
  { x: 0, opacity: 1, duration: MOVE_DUR, ease: MOVE_EASE },
  MOVE_START,
);
tl.to(blurProxy, { v: 0, duration: MOVE_DUR, ease: MOVE_EASE, onUpdate: writeBlur }, MOVE_START);

// Path B — ghosts on the SAME window/ease; per-ghost variation by index.
gsap.utils.toArray(".streak-ghost").forEach((g) => {
  const i = Number(g.dataset.i); // 1..N-1, set in HTML
  tl.fromTo(
    g,
    { x: ENTER_FROM_X - i * ECHO_STEP_PX, opacity: GHOST_BASE_OPACITY / i },
    { x: 0, opacity: 0, duration: MOVE_DUR, ease: MOVE_EASE },
    MOVE_START,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Vertical streak** — swap axes: `y`, `stdDeviation="0 Y"`, vertical echo offsets.
- **Camera push-through** — `scale: SCALE_FROM → 1` with a symmetric `"B B"` envelope (depth-wise smear, not directional): the wordmark punches out of soft focus and snaps crisp at the lock.
- **Staggered grid streak-in** — each card streaks into its slot at `MOVE_START + i * CARD_STAGGER` with its own blur proxy / ghosts; sharp the instant it lands.
- **Hold-the-streak** — blur on a marginally slower curve than position (position `expo.out`, blur `power3.out`) so the last wisp resolves just after arrival. Sparingly; default is locked envelopes.

## Camera-Travel Carve-Out

The envelope is also sanctioned at **wrapper level**: on the `.world` / camera wrapper of a virtual-camera scene ([viewport-change.md](viewport-change.md), [multi-phase-camera.md](multi-phase-camera.md), [3d-camera-flight.md](3d-camera-flight.md)) during a **travel leg** — a dive, a whip sweep, a violent final push. This does **not** violate "never a mid-composition exit": the world never leaves frame — the camera travels _through_ it, and every leg ends with the world at rest, sharp, inside the frame. Each leg is an **arrival** at the next pose, so the entrance doctrine applies leg by leg. Three deltas from the element-level recipe:

- **Envelope follows the leg's ease.** An `out` leg (dive, final push) uses the base recipe unchanged. An `inOut` repositioning leg peaks mid-leg: split the envelope at the velocity peak — `0 → PEAK` on the in-half ease over the first half, `PEAK → 0` on the out-half over the second. Seed the proxy at **0** for these (the streaked state lives mid-leg, not at t=0; seed-at-`PEAK_BLUR` belongs to the entrance shape, where the first frame IS the fastest).
- **Filter placement.** 2D camera: `filter: url(#streak)` on the `.world` wrapper. 3D flight: on the **perspective stage** above the 3D context — a `filter` on a `preserve-3d` element flattens it and collapses every `translateZ`. Never per-element inside the world: one frame-wide envelope, not N desynced ones.
- **Full-frame blur is heavy** — cap `PEAK_BLUR` ~18–20 at wrapper level (vs 30 for one element); a brief whip may touch ~24. Axis rule as usual: `"X 0"` for a lateral whip/pan, `"B B"` for a dive/push.

### Whip sweep (named composition)

The heavily-blurred lateral whip that resolves into the next region — two rules on one window:

1. **Position** — [nudge-curve.md](nudge-curve.md)'s three-phase chain on the camera state, tuned burst-dominant (tail still ≥3× ramp-in in time).
2. **Blur** — `0 → PEAK` across the ramp-in, held at `PEAK` through the linear burst (constant velocity = constant smear), `PEAK → 0` across the tail.

Swap or reveal the next region's content DURING the burst — the smear masks the change; the `power4.out` tail lands it sharp. Reveal during the burst, read after the tail.

```js
tl.to(cam, { x: WHIP_X * 0.1, duration: 0.12, ease: "power3.in", onUpdate: applyCamera }, WHIP_AT);
tl.to(
  cam,
  { x: WHIP_X * 0.75, duration: 0.1, ease: "none", onUpdate: applyCamera },
  WHIP_AT + 0.12,
);
tl.to(
  cam,
  { x: WHIP_X, duration: 0.35, ease: "power4.out", onUpdate: applyCamera },
  WHIP_AT + 0.22,
);

tl.to(blurProxy, { v: PEAK_BLUR, duration: 0.12, ease: "power3.in", onUpdate: writeBlur }, WHIP_AT);
// blur holds at PEAK through the linear burst (no tween needed — value rests at PEAK)
tl.to(blurProxy, { v: 0, duration: 0.35, ease: "power4.out", onUpdate: writeBlur }, WHIP_AT + 0.22);
```

## Critical Constraints

- Blur peaks at peak speed and resolves to 0 at the settle — share the ease and window between position and envelope. A blur that lingers after the stop reads as a focus pull.
- Entrances / mid-shot arrivals only — never a mid-composition exit; wrapper-level use only per the carve-out.
- Seed `stdDeviation` at setup: at `PEAK_BLUR` for the entrance shape, at 0 for a whip / `inOut` leg.
- Generous filter region (`x="-50%" y="-50%" width="200%" height="200%"`) or the smear clips at the element's box edge.
- Directional axis: `"X 0"` horizontal, `"0 Y"` vertical, `"B B"` only for a depth/scale move — symmetric blur on a sideways move looks like defocus.
- Dwell ≥1 s sharp after the snap; a streak landing at the last beat reads as "flashed and gone".
- Heavy element on a solid field — thin type (< ~120px / 800 weight) or a busy backdrop swallows the smear.
- `overflow: hidden` on the scene — the smear / furthest ghost extends past the resting position during travel.

# Multi-Phase Camera

A camera wrapper around the ENTIRE scene that progresses through discrete zoom phases at scripted triggers, with continuous sine-driven micro-drift overlaid so the camera never feels static between phases. Distinct from a single linear zoom — multi-phase creates cinematic pacing (anticipation → reveal → settle).

## How It Works

The camera is one wrapping `<div>` whose `transform: scale() translate(x, y)` is composed from two channels inside a single `onUpdate` writer:

1. **Phase scale** — a proxy object `{ scale }` stepped through phases at trigger times (`PHASE_1_SCALE` at t=0 → `PHASE_2_SCALE` at `PHASE_2_AT` → `PHASE_3_SCALE` at `PHASE_3_AT`).
2. **Drift offset** — a continuous sine-based `translateX` / `translateY` (small amplitude, slow frequency) ADDED to the phase transform. X and Y run at slightly different frequencies (`DRIFT_FREQ_RATIO ≈ 1.3`) — equal frequencies produce a perfect diagonal that reads mechanical; ~1.3 gives an organic Lissajous.

## Recipe

    <div class="hero">{Brand}</div>
    <div class="tagline">{tagline}</div>
    <div class="cta">{ctaText}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.scene {
  overflow: hidden; /* REQUIRED — any phase scale < 1 exposes the content's edges */
  background: {sceneBgColor}; /* background on .scene, NOT .camera — a camera-borne

}

  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  transform-origin: 50% 50%; /* off-center origin creates phase-to-phase drift */

}
```

```js
const camera = document.getElementById("camera");

// Three-phase scale plan: pullback → focus → push.
const phase = { scale: PHASE_1_SCALE }; // Phase 1 is the initial value — no tween

// Phase 2 — settle to neutral focus
tl.to(phase, { scale: PHASE_2_SCALE, duration: PHASE_2_DUR, ease: PHASE_2_EASE }, PHASE_2_AT);

// Phase 3 — slow push-in for the climax
tl.to(phase, { scale: PHASE_3_SCALE, duration: PHASE_3_DUR, ease: PHASE_3_EASE }, PHASE_3_AT);

// Drift driver — continuous sine motion overlaid on the phase scale.
// The ONE writer of camera.style.transform.
const drift = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  drift,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * DRIFT_CYCLES,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION, // spans the whole composition
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const dx = Math.sin(drift.p) * DRIFT_AMP_X;
      const dy = Math.sin(drift.p * DRIFT_FREQ_RATIO) * DRIFT_AMP_Y;
      camera.style.transform = `scale(${phase.scale}) translate(${dx}px, ${dy}px)`;
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Content reveals happen INSIDE the camera frame (hero/tagline/cta beats).
```

## Phase Patterns

| Pattern             | Scale sequence (1 → 2 → 3)        | Feel                            | When to use                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Focus-in**        | back → neutral → slight push      | Approach → settle → slight push | Default product reveal        |
| **Dramatic reveal** | push → neutral → pull             | Wide → focus → settle back      | Hero shot with breathing room |
| **Steady push**     | neutral → slight push → more push | Gradual forward momentum        | Continuous narrative push     |
| **Bookend pull**    | neutral → strong push → neutral   | Settle → push → release         | CTA emphasis then release     |

## Variations

- **Phase trigger by content beat**: align a camera tween's start with a content tween's end (entry completes → push begins) rather than a fixed clock value.
- **Camera shake (panic / impact)**: a brief higher-amplitude, higher-frequency drift tween over a short window — same `drift` mechanism with `SHAKE_AMP` / `SHAKE_CYCLES` / `SHAKE_DUR` at `SHAKE_AT`.
- **Targeted zoom into an off-center element**: combine scale with counter-translation so the target lands at viewport center — divide the measured offset by the current scale before feeding it into the writer:

```js
const tRect = document.querySelector(".cta").getBoundingClientRect();
const offsetX = (STAGE_W / 2 - (tRect.left + tRect.width / 2)) / phase.scale;
const offsetY = (STAGE_H / 2 - (tRect.top + tRect.height / 2)) / phase.scale;
// then in onUpdate: translate(offsetX + dx, offsetY + dy)
```

## Critical Constraints

- **Camera wraps EVERYTHING in the scene** — a per-element camera creates parallax bugs and breaks the "one viewpoint" read.
- **One writer**: phase scale and drift compose inside the single drift `onUpdate`; nothing else touches `camera.style.transform`.
- **`overflow: hidden` on `.scene`** — required whenever any phase scale < 1.
- **`transform-origin: 50% 50%` on `.camera`** — off-center origin creates unpredictable phase-to-phase drift.
- **Scene background on `.scene`, not `.camera`** — otherwise scaling/translating reveals the outer void.
- **Hero reveal starts AFTER the initial pull-back ease lands** — otherwise the headline feels like it's flying away.

# Stat Bars & Fills

The graphics that give a stat **visual weight** beside its number: a small bar chart, a progress bar/ring filling to a percentage, or a star row filling to a fractional rating. Pair these with [counting-dynamic-scale.md](counting-dynamic-scale.md) (the number) for a complete stat scene.

**Layout blueprint — pick ONE and hold it across all stats:**

- **Single-focus** — one centered frame, the number is the hero, a ring or bar sits under/around it. Cleanest for a sequential reveal (stat 1 → stat 2 → stat 3 in the same frame).
- **Split-frame** — big number on the left, paired graphic on the right. Better when stats are shown together or each needs a distinct visual.

Don't mix blueprints between stats in one piece — that reads as inconsistent.

## Recipe

### 1 — Growth Bars (CSS `scaleY` stagger)

Bars grow from the baseline with a stagger; the last bar is the accent. Heights are authored in CSS (inline height per bar); GSAP only reveals `scaleY: 0 → 1` — never animate `height`.

```css
.bars {
  display: flex;
  align-items: flex-end;
  gap: 14px;
  height: 280px;
}
.bar {
  width: 48px;
  background: #3a4a64;
  transform: scaleY(0);
  transform-origin: bottom center; /* grow UP from the baseline, not from center */
}
.bar:last-child {
  background: #ffc300; /* accent the final/current bar */
}
```

```js
tl.to(".bar", { scaleY: 1, duration: 0.7, ease: "power3.out", stagger: 0.08 }, 0.3);
```

### 2 — Progress Fill

**Bar form** — `scaleX` from a left origin:

```css
.track {
  width: 520px;
  height: 16px;
  background: #1b263b;
  border-radius: 8px;
  overflow: hidden;
}
/* width:100% is REQUIRED — an absolutely-positioned fill with no width is 0px, and scaleX of 0 is
   still 0 → the bar renders invisible (automated gates may miss a zero-width scaled element). */
.fill {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background: #ffc300;
  transform: scaleX(0);
  transform-origin: left center;
}
```

```js
const PCT = 0.92; // 92%
tl.to(".fill", { scaleX: PCT, duration: 1.0, ease: "power2.out" }, 0.3);
```

**Ring form** — measured stroke draw (mechanics in [svg-path-draw.md](svg-path-draw.md)):

```js
const ring = document.querySelector("#ring");
const LEN = ring.getTotalLength(); // measure, don't hard-code the circumference
ring.style.strokeDasharray = LEN;
ring.style.strokeDashoffset = LEN; // empty
// rotate the <circle> -90deg in CSS so the fill starts at 12 o'clock
tl.to(ring, { strokeDashoffset: LEN * (1 - 0.92), duration: 1.1, ease: "power2.out" }, 0.3);
```

### 3 — Star-Rating Fill (fractional)

A gold star row revealed left-to-right to a fractional value (e.g. 4.6 / 5) via a clip wipe over a gold layer sitting on a gray layer.

```html
<div class="stars">
  <div class="stars-gray">★★★★★</div>
  <div class="stars-gold" id="goldStars">★★★★★</div>
</div>
```

```css
.stars {
  position: relative;
  font-size: 64px;
  letter-spacing: 8px;
}
.stars-gray {
  color: #2b3548;
}
.stars-gold {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  color: #ffc300;
  width: 100%;
  clip-path: inset(0 100% 0 0);
}
```

```js
const RATING = 4.6,
  MAX = 5;
tl.to(
  "#goldStars",
  { clipPath: `inset(0 ${100 - (RATING / MAX) * 100}% 0 0)`, duration: 1.0, ease: "power2.out" },
  0.3,
);
```

| ------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| bar count     | 4–6         | reads as "a trend" without clutter; the last bar is the current/accent value        |
| fill duration | 0.8–1.2s    | matched to the paired count-up so number and graphic land together (share the ease) |
| stagger       | 0.06–0.1s   | larger feels sluggish, 0 loses the build                                            |
| accent hue    | exactly one | bars/fill/stars all use the same accent, the rest is muted                          |

## Critical Constraints

- **`scaleY` / `scaleX` / `clipPath`, never `height`/`width` tweens** — author each bar's final height in CSS and scale from 0.
- **`transform-origin`** must be `bottom` (bars grow up) / `left` (fills grow right) — the default center origin scales from the middle and looks wrong.
- **`.fill` needs `width: 100%`** — a zero-width fill scaled by any factor is still invisible, and automated gates may miss it.
- **Measure, don't hard-code** — ring length via `getTotalLength()`; a hard-coded circumference breaks if the radius changes.
- **Match the number's timing** — the fill and the count-up peak together (same start + ease) so the stat resolves as one beat, not two; a paired counter's `onUpdate` must be O(1) (see [counting-dynamic-scale.md](counting-dynamic-scale.md)).
- **One accent hue, consistent blueprint** — see `hyperframes-creative/references/data-in-motion.md`.

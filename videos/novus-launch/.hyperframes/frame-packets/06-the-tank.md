- sfx: riser, impact-bass-2

Adapt: keep the continuous multi-leg camera journey; legs are expressed as one slow push + two focus pulls across the plate (no cuts), depth-of-field doing the storytelling.
Scene 1 (0.0–2.4s): On "Five investors.", the tank plate fills the frame full-bleed, camera already moving — one continuous slow push toward the desk (`multi-phase-camera`, single unbroken move for the whole 9s); a soft depth-of-field blur (`depth-of-field-blur`) holds everything except the center shark. Mono kicker "THE TANK" bottom-left at label ramp (inside safe area, above caption band).
Scene 2 (2.4–5.6s): On "They've read your books. They heard your ums.", the focus PULLS left then right across the panel (`depth-of-field-blur` refocusing leg by leg, one pull per spoken cue) — each shark sharpening as the line about them lands. On "ums", three tiny alert-red tick marks flicker at the frame's lower third and die (filler words, counted — 0.5s, gone).
Scene 3 (5.6–9.0s): On "Sixty seconds — out loud.", focus returns to the full desk as the push completes its landing; the line "sixty seconds. out loud." reveals lower-center per-word in white h3 over the plate's darkest region. Camera settles to stillness for the final second — the held read before the stakes. No other motion.

narrativeRole: The climax — the camera meets the panel. Everything the sim built is about to be judged.
keyMessage: You pitch on camera to five sharks who know your numbers.

# Depth-of-Field Blur (Selective Focus / Rack Focus)

Pulls the eye to one focal element by **blurring** (and slightly **dimming**) everything around it while the focal layer stays sharp — the camera's depth-of-field falling off the background, or a rack-focus shifting which plane is in focus. `filter` and `opacity` are paint-only, so both tween seek-safe. This is the backing rule for the focus-falloff beat the blueprints reach for: outer nodes blurring during a push-in (`constellation-hub`), rack-focus across a parallax card stack (`cursor-ui-demo`), non-highlighted cards dimming to spotlight a hero metric (`dataviz-countup`).

## How It Works

Every layer carries a `--dof` custom property (px of blur), read by `filter: blur(var(--dof))`, plus its own `opacity`. A GSAP tween advances each layer's `--dof` from `0` to its target blur and its opacity from `1` to a dim level over the focus-shift window. The focal layer's `--dof` stays `0`. Per-layer targets derive from `data-depth` / index, so the falloff is identical on every seek.

Three mechanics, same primitive:

1. **Focal pull** — one window: off-focus layers go sharp(0) → blurred while the focal layer holds at 0. The eye is pulled to the only thing still crisp.
2. **Rack focus** — two adjacent windows on the same property: plane A's blur ramps 0 → max at the same position plane B's ramps max → 0. State continuity matters exactly as in `press-release-spring`: A's resting blur after the rack must equal what B held before it — author both as tweens on the same `--dof` at the same position so the hand-off is seamless.
3. **Blur-the-cluster-while-pushing-in** — the DoF tween runs at the SAME timeline position as a camera push-in (`multi-phase-camera` / `coordinate-target-zoom`): "the world recedes" and "we push in" read as one move.

## Recipe

```html
<div class="world" id="world">
  <!-- Focal layer — stays sharp -->
  <div class="layer focal" id="focal">{FocalLabel}</div>
  <!-- Off-focus layers — blur + dim; data-depth orders near→far -->
  <div class="layer ctx" data-depth="1">{Context A}</div>
  <div class="layer ctx" data-depth="2">{Context B}</div>
  <div class="layer ctx" data-depth="3">{Context C}</div>
</div>
```

```css
.world {
  /* single wrapper so a concurrent camera push-in transforms everything
     together; DoF is independent of the camera */
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  transform-origin: 50% 50%;
}
.layer {
  --dof: 0px; /* px of blur; filter reads it — starts sharp */
  filter: blur(var(--dof));
  will-change: filter; /* promotes the layer so per-frame re-rasterization is cheap */
}
.focal {
  z-index: 2; /* sharp layer must sit ABOVE the blurred ones, or its crisp
     edges read as bleeding into the haze */
}
.ctx {
  z-index: 1;
}
```

```js
// Mechanic 1 — FOCAL PULL. Blur scales with data-depth so far planes blur
// more than near ones; the focal layer (--dof: 0, opacity: 1) is untouched.
gsap.utils.toArray(".ctx").forEach((el) => {
  const depth = Number(el.dataset.depth) || 1;
  tl.to(
    el,
    {
      "--dof": `${BLUR_PER_DEPTH * depth}px`,
      opacity: DIM_LEVEL, // dim, not gone
      duration: FOCUS_DUR,
      ease: "power2.inOut",
    },
    FOCUS_START,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Rack focus between two depth planes** — `gsap.set` plane B pre-blurred BEFORE the rack (no pop), then two tweens sharing `RACK_START` + `RACK_DUR`: A → `MAX_BLUR` + `DIM_LEVEL`, B → `0px` + `1`. Shared window makes them cross at the midpoint.
- **Blur the cluster while pushing in** — run the focal-pull tweens at the same position + duration as a camera tween on `#world` (`scale/x/y`, `power2.inOut`). Camera transforms the world; DoF tweens the layers — independent property channels, no conflict.
- **Spotlight a hero metric in a card grid** — `gsap.utils.toArray(".card:not(.hero)")` all defocus (`GRID_BLUR` + `DIM_LEVEL`) on one shared window; heroes are skipped.
- **Refocus / settle** — if the beat resolves back to "everything visible" (or hands off to a crossfade needing a clean outgoing frame), ramp all `--dof` back to `0px` / opacity 1 over the tail (`REFOCUS_START + REFOCUS_DUR ≤ DURATION`).
- **Bounded focus-breathing on the focal layer (optional)** — a finite `ease:"none"` driver writes `Math.max(0, Math.sin(p)) * FOCAL_BREATH_PX` into the focal `--dof` during a hold. Keep it ≤ ~0.6px or it reads as "still focusing"; default to omitting it.

| FOCAL vs CTX sizing   | context smaller / grouped              | small context layers let a modest radius still read as "out of focus" — and blur cheaply                 |

Tokens: dark `{bgGradient}` so the sharp focal layer reads as lit and forward; heavy display `{font}` weight — blurred copy needs it to stay shape-legible.

## Critical Constraints

- **Tween the `--dof` variable on the timeline** — reading `filter: blur(var(--dof))` keeps the blur on the HF seek clock.
- **Blur the SMALL / GROUPED layers, not the giant one.** Filter cost scales with radius × pixel area; a 20 px blur on a full-frame background is the worst case. Keep per-layer radius ≤ ~24 px on large surfaces and lean on the `opacity` **dim** to do the push-back work — dim + modest blur reads more like real DoF than blur cranked to the max.
- **`will-change: filter`** on every layer whose blur animates (drop it after settle if the layer also does heavy transform work).
- **Focal layer stays genuinely sharp** — `--dof: 0`, untouched (or breathing ≤ 0.6 px). Any visible blur on the focal element kills the "this is the thing" read.
- **State continuity on a rack** — the outgoing plane starts at the blur the incoming plane was holding, and vice-versa; adjacent tweens on the same `--dof` at the same position.
- **DoF is independent of the camera** — blur the layers, transform `.world` for the push-in; don't fake DoF with the camera transform or vice-versa.
- **Settle sharp before a hand-off** — refocus to `--dof: 0` in the tail if the next beat is a crossfade/push; handing off mid-defocus reads as "the render glitched."
- **Sharp focal layer above blurred layers** (`z-index`).

# Multi-Phase Camera

A camera wrapper around the ENTIRE scene that progresses through discrete zoom phases at scripted triggers, with continuous sine-driven micro-drift overlaid so the camera never feels static between phases. Distinct from a single linear zoom — multi-phase creates cinematic pacing (anticipation → reveal → settle).

## How It Works

The camera is one wrapping `<div>` whose `transform: scale() translate(x, y)` is composed from two channels inside a single `onUpdate` writer:

1. **Phase scale** — a proxy object `{ scale }` stepped through phases at trigger times (`PHASE_1_SCALE` at t=0 → `PHASE_2_SCALE` at `PHASE_2_AT` → `PHASE_3_SCALE` at `PHASE_3_AT`).
2. **Drift offset** — a continuous sine-based `translateX` / `translateY` (small amplitude, slow frequency) ADDED to the phase transform. X and Y run at slightly different frequencies (`DRIFT_FREQ_RATIO ≈ 1.3`) — equal frequencies produce a perfect diagonal that reads mechanical; ~1.3 gives an organic Lissajous.

## Recipe

```html
<div class="camera" id="camera">
  <div class="content">
    <div class="hero">{Brand}</div>
    <div class="tagline">{tagline}</div>
    <div class="cta">{ctaText}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.scene {
  overflow: hidden; /* REQUIRED — any phase scale < 1 exposes the content's edges */
  background: {sceneBgColor}; /* background on .scene, NOT .camera — a camera-borne
     background warps/translates with the transform and reveals the outer void */
}
.camera {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  transform-origin: 50% 50%; /* off-center origin creates phase-to-phase drift */
  will-change: transform;
}
```

```js
const camera = document.getElementById("camera");

// Three-phase scale plan: pullback → focus → push.
const phase = { scale: PHASE_1_SCALE }; // Phase 1 is the initial value — no tween

// Phase 2 — settle to neutral focus
tl.to(phase, { scale: PHASE_2_SCALE, duration: PHASE_2_DUR, ease: PHASE_2_EASE }, PHASE_2_AT);

// Phase 3 — slow push-in for the climax
tl.to(phase, { scale: PHASE_3_SCALE, duration: PHASE_3_DUR, ease: PHASE_3_EASE }, PHASE_3_AT);

// Drift driver — continuous sine motion overlaid on the phase scale.
// The ONE writer of camera.style.transform.
const drift = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  drift,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * DRIFT_CYCLES,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION, // spans the whole composition
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const dx = Math.sin(drift.p) * DRIFT_AMP_X;
      const dy = Math.sin(drift.p * DRIFT_FREQ_RATIO) * DRIFT_AMP_Y;
      camera.style.transform = `scale(${phase.scale}) translate(${dx}px, ${dy}px)`;
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Content reveals happen INSIDE the camera frame (hero/tagline/cta beats).
```

## Phase Patterns

| Pattern             | Scale sequence (1 → 2 → 3)        | Feel                            | When to use                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Focus-in**        | back → neutral → slight push      | Approach → settle → slight push | Default product reveal        |
| **Dramatic reveal** | push → neutral → pull             | Wide → focus → settle back      | Hero shot with breathing room |
| **Steady push**     | neutral → slight push → more push | Gradual forward momentum        | Continuous narrative push     |
| **Bookend pull**    | neutral → strong push → neutral   | Settle → push → release         | CTA emphasis then release     |

## Variations

- **Phase trigger by content beat**: align a camera tween's start with a content tween's end (entry completes → push begins) rather than a fixed clock value.
- **Camera shake (panic / impact)**: a brief higher-amplitude, higher-frequency drift tween over a short window — same `drift` mechanism with `SHAKE_AMP` / `SHAKE_CYCLES` / `SHAKE_DUR` at `SHAKE_AT`.
- **Targeted zoom into an off-center element**: combine scale with counter-translation so the target lands at viewport center — divide the measured offset by the current scale before feeding it into the writer:

```js
const tRect = document.querySelector(".cta").getBoundingClientRect();
const offsetX = (STAGE_W / 2 - (tRect.left + tRect.width / 2)) / phase.scale;
const offsetY = (STAGE_H / 2 - (tRect.top + tRect.height / 2)) / phase.scale;
// then in onUpdate: translate(offsetX + dx, offsetY + dy)
```

## Critical Constraints

- **Camera wraps EVERYTHING in the scene** — a per-element camera creates parallax bugs and breaks the "one viewpoint" read.
- **One writer**: phase scale and drift compose inside the single drift `onUpdate`; nothing else touches `camera.style.transform`.
- **`overflow: hidden` on `.scene`** — required whenever any phase scale < 1.
- **`transform-origin: 50% 50%` on `.camera`** — off-center origin creates unpredictable phase-to-phase drift.
- **Scene background on `.scene`, not `.camera`** — otherwise scaling/translating reveals the outer void.
- **Hero reveal starts AFTER the initial pull-back ease lands** — otherwise the headline feels like it's flying away.
